## What does it do?

DXVK is a translation layer that converts DirectX calls to Vulkan. It can **boost FPS in older games** and fix compatibility issues on modern systems. The problem? Installing it manually is tedious—downloading archives, picking the right DLLs, editing config files.

**DXVK Studio automates all of that.** Point it at your games, pick a version, click install. Done.

---

## Features

- **Auto-detects your games** from Steam, GOG Galaxy, and Epic Games Store
- **Handles 32-bit and 64-bit** automatically by reading executable headers
- **Multiple DXVK forks** — Official, GPL Async (shader stutter fix), and NVAPI
- **Safe installs** — backs up original DLLs before any changes
- **Visual config editor** — tweak HUD, VSync, FPS limits without touching files
- **Anti-cheat warnings** — alerts you before modifying online games
- **Activity logs** — see everything the app has done

---

## Installation

> **License Notice**: Source code is free and open under AGPL-3.0 with additional terms. **Binary distribution is prohibited.** Only the copyright holder (Zendevve) may distribute compiled binaries. Users may build from source for personal use only, or purchase official builds. See LICENSE.ADDITIONAL for complete terms.

---

### Option 1: Buy Pre-Built (Recommended)

**[Get DXVK Studio on Gumroad →](https://guinto2.gumroad.com/l/dxvkstudio)**

Download, run the installer, done. Supports ongoing development.

**System Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Vulkan-capable GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel Arc)

> **⚠️ Note:** The installer is not code-signed (code signing certificates cost $200-400/year). Windows SmartScreen may show a warning on first run—click **"More info" → "Run anyway"** to proceed. This is safe and expected for indie software.

---

### Option 2: Build From Source

For developers who prefer to compile the application themselves.

#### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed and properly configured:

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | v20.0.0+ (LTS) | [Download](https://nodejs.org/) — includes npm. Verify with `node -v` |
| **npm** | v10.0.0+ | Comes with Node.js. Verify with `npm -v` |
| **Git** | Latest | [Download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) — required for cloning |
| **Python** | 3.10+ | [Download](https://python.org) — required by node-gyp for native modules |
| **Visual Studio Build Tools** | 2022 | [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) — required for compiling native Node.js addons |

> **⚠️ Important:** The Visual Studio Build Tools installation requires selecting the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload, which includes the MSVC compiler, Windows SDK, and CMake tools. This is approximately **6-8 GB** of disk space.

#### Native Module Dependencies

This project uses `better-sqlite3`, a native Node.js addon that requires compilation during installation. If you encounter errors during `npm install`, ensure:

1. Python is in your system PATH
2. Visual Studio Build Tools are installed with C++ workload
3. You're running the terminal as Administrator (if permission errors occur)

#### Build Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zendevve/dxvk-studio.git
cd dxvk-studio

# 2. Install dependencies (may take several minutes due to native compilation)
npm install

# 3. Verify the installation succeeded
npm test

# 4. Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev
```

#### Creating a Production Build

To create distributable binaries:

```bash
# Full production build (TypeScript compilation + Vite bundling + Electron packaging)
npm run build
```

This generates:
- `release/DXVK Studio Setup X.X.X.exe` — NSIS installer
- `release/DXVK Studio X.X.X.exe` — Portable executable

> **Note:** The build process requires all native dependencies to be properly compiled. If you encounter errors, ensure your Visual Studio Build Tools installation includes the Windows 10/11 SDK.

#### Troubleshooting Build Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `node-gyp` fails | Install Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ workload |
| `better-sqlite3` compilation error | Run `npm config set msvs_version 2022` then reinstall |
| Python not found | Add Python to PATH or run `npm config set python /path/to/python.exe` |
| EACCES permission denied | Run terminal as Administrator |
| Electron download fails | Check firewall/proxy settings; Electron binaries are ~100MB |

---

## Usage

1. Launch the app — your games appear automatically
2. Click a game → choose fork and version → click **Install**
3. To undo, click **Uninstall** — original files are restored

## For Developers

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Electron 33 |
| UI | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Styling | TailwindCSS |
| Build | Vite + electron-builder |
| Testing | Vitest |
| Database | better-sqlite3 (native addon) |

### Architecture

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start with hot reload
npm test             # Run test suite
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run build        # Production build
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Windows-first**: Registry queries, PE parsing, native paths — built for Windows from day one
- **Offline-capable**: Downloaded engines are cached locally
- **Non-destructive**: Every install creates backups; uninstall always works
- **No admin required**: Operates entirely in user space

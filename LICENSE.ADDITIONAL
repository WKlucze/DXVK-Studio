                    ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR DXVK STUDIO

Copyright (C) 2024-2026 Zendevve
All Rights Reserved for Binary Distribution

These additional terms supplement the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
("AGPL-3.0") under which DXVK Studio is licensed. Section 7 of the AGPL-3.0
explicitly permits these additional restrictions.

================================================================================
                            REDISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS
================================================================================

1. PROHIBITION ON BINARY DISTRIBUTION

   You may NOT distribute, publish, or make available to any third parties
   compiled, built, or executable forms of this software. This prohibition
   includes but is not limited to:

   a) Installer packages (.exe, .msi, .zip archives containing binaries)
   b) Pre-compiled builds or releases for end-user installation
   c) Executable files shared via any medium (hosting sites, Discord, forums, etc.)
   d) Repackaged or bundled distributions containing compiled binaries
   e) Automated build systems that provide binaries to the public

   This restriction applies regardless of:
   - Whether distribution is commercial or free of charge
   - Whether source code is included alongside binaries
   - Whether the binaries are modified or unmodified
   - The platform or distribution method used

2. PERMITTED USES

   You MAY:

   a) Build the software from source code for your personal, non-commercial use
   b) Modify the source code for your own private purposes
   c) Distribute the uncompiled source code (in compliance with AGPL-3.0)
   d) Contribute code improvements to the official repository
   e) Assist others by sharing build instructions (not pre-built binaries)

   Note: "Personal use" means use by you alone. You may not build binaries
   for distribution to others, even friends or family members.

3. RESERVED RIGHTS

   The copyright holder (Zendevve) exclusively reserves the right to:

   a) Create and distribute compiled binaries
   b) Publish official releases and installer packages
   c) Offer the software as a commercial product
   d) Authorize specific third parties for binary distribution
   e) Grant exceptions to these restrictions

   No other person or entity has permission to distribute binaries without
   explicit written authorization from the copyright holder.

4. RETROACTIVE APPLICATION

   These terms apply retroactively to all versions of DXVK Studio, including
   versions released before this LICENSE.ADDITIONAL file was created.

   If you obtained binaries or source code before 2026-01-02, you are now
   bound by these terms. This includes:

   - All previous releases (v1.0.0 and earlier)
   - All commits in the repository history
   - Any forks or copies made before these terms were published

   If you have already distributed binaries:

   You must within 7 days of becoming aware of these terms:
   1. Remove all distributed binaries from all platforms and services
   2. Delete hosted files from GitHub Releases, file sharing sites, etc.
   3. Notify recipients that the distribution was unauthorized
   4. Cease all future binary distribution

   Failure to comply will be treated as willful copyright infringement.

5. ENFORCEMENT

   Distribution of binaries in violation of these terms constitutes:

   - Copyright infringement under applicable copyright law
   - Material breach of the license agreement
   - Grounds for legal action

   The copyright holder may pursue remedies including:

   - DMCA takedown notices to hosting providers
   - Cease and desist letters
   - Copyright infringement litigation
   - Statutory damages as provided by law (up to $150,000 per work under US law)
   - Injunctive relief to prevent further unauthorized distribution
   - Recovery of attorney fees and legal costs

6. RATIONALE

   These restrictions serve important purposes:

   - Protecting users from potentially malicious or compromised unofficial builds
   - Ensuring quality control and code signing for distributed binaries
   - Preventing confusion between official and unofficial releases
   - Maintaining project integrity and reputation
   - Supporting sustainable development through official distribution channels

7. RELATIONSHIP TO AGPL-3.0

   These additional terms supplement the AGPL-3.0; they do not replace it.

   All AGPL-3.0 obligations remain in effect, including:
   - Source code must remain publicly available
   - Modifications must be shared if distributed
   - Network use triggers source code disclosure requirements

   Section 7(b) of the AGPL-3.0 explicitly permits additional restrictions
   such as these.

8. OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

   The only authorized sources for compiled binaries are:

   - Official Store: https://guinto2.gumroad.com/l/dxvkstudio
   - Official Releases: https://github.com/Zendevve/dxvk-studio/releases
     (only if posted by @Zendevve)

   Any other source is unauthorized and violates this license.

9. REQUESTING PERMISSION

   If you wish to distribute binaries, you must obtain written permission
   from the copyright holder before doing so. Contact via:

   GitHub Issues: https://github.com/Zendevve/dxvk-studio/issues

   Requests will be evaluated individually. Permission is granted at the
   sole discretion of the copyright holder.

10. ACCEPTANCE

    By using, compiling, modifying, or distributing this software in any form,
    you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and agree to
    be legally bound by them in addition to the AGPL-3.0 license.

    If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use this software.
